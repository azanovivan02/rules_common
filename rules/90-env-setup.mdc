# Environment Setup and Infrastructure

## Environment Setup
- The app runs entirely locally using Docker Compose for infrastructure (Postgres, Redis).
- No cloud dependencies other than the LLM API endpoint.
- Assume `localhost` for all service connections.

## Docker Infrastructure
- All infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis) run via Docker Compose.
- Development, local, and production configurations are managed through separate Docker Compose files in the `docker/` directory.
